## Overview
Following Scrimba's learn JavaScript tutorial I made a clicker counter to track the number of people wearing hats per street / area.

## The Process
Taking things step by step from implementing a simple function that increments counts to connecting eventlisteners and styling the app. I updated the code a little to avoid having a hanging '-' after the most recent entry and to add a clear button to avoid having to reload the page.

### Built with
HTML
CSS
JS
Netlify

### What I learnt
- You can grab a colour eyedropper from any colour picker in dev tools to use in the browser window.
- Alternatives (though not recommended) to addEventListener, applying 'onclick' directly onto the HTML element.
- Working with a busy background image. Although adding a transparent background to text helped readability it made the app look pretty scruffy. I went back to relying on text shadow.
- Embedding google fonts
- Using emoji's as favicons in chrome/firefox.

### Continued development
- If I were to continue with this project I would work more on the css/html to make it more accessible.
- I'd try to add an option to properly save data locally
- Cater it towards a more realistic use.
